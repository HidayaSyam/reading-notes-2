# ***Operators & Loops***
> ## Comparison operators 
- `==`: compares two values, its mean "equal"
- `===`: compare two values and data type, its mean "strict equal to".
- `!=`: compares two values, its mean "not equal to".
- `!==`: compares two values, its mean "strict not equal to".
-  `>`: greater than, `<`: less than
- `>=`: greater than or equal to 
- `<`: less than or equal to.

> ## Logical operator
These operators return a value which can be "true" or "false".
- `&&`: It is mean "and", it return true only when the two expressions is true or met the condition.
- `||`: it is mean "or", and rturn a true value if one -at least- of the expressions met the condition. 
- `!`: it returns the opposite value of the expression.

> ## loops
We use loops usually for repeted operations or tasks, and can do it by two main statments:
- `For statment`: we use it for limited loops, we know how much time we will repret it.
- `while statment`: we use it when we didnt know when the loop eill stop.
