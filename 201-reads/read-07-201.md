> ## Tables in HTML
- Usually we use tables to store information and data.
- Tables consist of: cells, colomns, and rows. to add table to the web page we use < table > tag.
- < tr > is used to add a row, the table added row by row, and when add a row it already been the first row & first coloumn.
- inside every row there are group of cells, to represent the cells in our file we use the tag: < td >.
- If your table is long, you can divide it to 3 main parts:
  - < thead >: the head of table.
  - < tbody >: the body of table.
  - < tfoot >: the footer of table.

## Objects 
- The variables in object can known as properties, they can be as single variable, or array.
- we can use objects to deal with global objects, and to work with decimal numbers.
