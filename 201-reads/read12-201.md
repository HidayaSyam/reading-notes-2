## Charts on your page

we use charts to display data in simple and clear way, it's more readable than texts and other ways of information writing.
To get started with adding charts to pages we should add file with the name "Chart.min.js" and link it in html file.
we link it at the head of html file, then write down its line:
`< canvas id="buyers" width="600" height="400"></ canvas >`
then add a script to your html file before the closing tag of the body.
you can also add:
`drawing a pie chart`
then added some options styling and data :))
- and to animate the type of chart you can add your options such as give a true value so that it zooms out from nothing.
"var pieOptions = {
	segmentShowStroke : false,
	animateScale : true`
}"
- drawing bar chart and add its data and labeling, for example you can see this code from [Web Design blog](https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2013/11/easily-create-stunning-animated-charts-with-chart-js/):
var pieData = [
	{
		value: 20,
		color:"#878BB6"
	},
	{
		value : 40,
		color : "#4ACAB4"
	},
	{
		value : 10,
		color : "#FF8153"
	},
	{
		value : 30,
		color : "#FFEA88"
	}
];
