# ***Design web pages with CSS***
We use colors in our websites to give it a vital appearance, and will be more reactive for people who visit the website.

# ***To determine a color in CSS there are three basic ways***:
-	RGB values; which refer to Red, Green, Blue colors.
-	Hex codes; depend on hexadecimal codes 
-	Color names; they are more than 100 colors.

# ***Color properties***:
-	HUE: general idea about the color.
-	Saturation: The amount of grey in a color.
-	Brightness: How much black in the color.
-	Lightness: The amount of white (lightness) or black (darkness) in acolor.
-	Opacity: determined the opacity of the element as a number between 0 & 1.
-	hsl, hsla : properties of color that introduced in CSS3, alternative way to specify colors. 
-	Alpha: expressed as a number between 0 and 1, represent the transparency. 
-	ph scale: every color  represent  a  level of acidity or alkalinity, and these are specified using RGB values.
# ***Contrast***:
There are three types of contrast; low contras, high contrast, medium contrast.
We should not use the low contrast because it hard for visitors to read the texts, the high contrast is better but also it is not perfect for long reading, the medium contrast is the best for long texts.
