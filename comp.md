# ***About computers***

- ## ***How computers work?***
  - We use computers in our life to make it easier, and to help in solve problems some times. 
  The thing that make computers computers, is 4 main tasks that all the computers do: *`take input & store them & process them, then produce them as output`*.

 - ## ***Bainary and Data***
   - all computers work on the binary system, which consist of zeroes and ones.
   all the process from the simpliest one to the most complicated depend on this system.

- ## ***Circut & Logic***
  - Inside the computers there are millions of tiny pieces that work together to give us a circut.
  these circuts mpdify and compine the inputs signals ato give outputs or results.

 - ## ***CPU, Memory, Inputs and Outputs***
   - the inputs that enter to the computer all defined in the binary system, for example: photos consist of millions or more of color, each color has a number, each number can defined as zers and ones. Sound also can be defined as zeroes and ones, by plot it as a wave it wil give us specific numbers.
   this happen when input enter o the computer, stored in the memory and then process in CPU, to have a different results.
