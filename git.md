# Git, GitHub, and Version Control System

-	Version control system is an important thing for the developer because it let them come back to their projects or files that they editing. Adding, or do any specific change on them.
-	Git is the system help to dealing with different version, and tracking changes.
-	GitHub  is differ than Git, it’s an online service which store coding remotely.

>The project in Git is in our local machine, while it is in GitHub stored in a cloud.
In GitHub we create something called “repository”, it is like a file but located in cloud.
The process of which I copy a repository in my machine called clone.
GitHub doesn’t aware about the changes I have done on the project located in my machine.

To updated GitHub repository you should do the following steps:
-	Add the files that you changed to VC. The files should be staged there.
-	Commit; keep track on these files. Its usually come with massage
-	Push!, no changes on files will reflect on GitHub if you did not push it.
